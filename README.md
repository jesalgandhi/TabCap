# TabCap

This tool allows you to set a limit for how many tabs you can have open (across all windows) at once. 

This is done so that you do not open too many tabs at once when trying to research something, ending up with a clutter of tabs and no clear direction. Instead, this extension encourages you to close other content to focus on whatever you are doing. Alternatively, this can be a good tool if you want to speed up your browsing experience, as more tabs = more RAM = slower computer. 

The extension should be pinned to the toolbar, as a badge will show up telling you how many tabs in total you currently have open. If you are well below the limit, the badge is green; otherwise, the badge will be orange, or red if you are very close to your set limit. You can change the limit by right-clicking the extension and clicking Options.
